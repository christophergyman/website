    <h1>Major Project Milestone</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">home</a>
    <p class="quote">02 January 2025</p>
    <p>
        Thrilled to share a major milestone in my journey at <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/">ACAS</a>!
    </p>

    <p>
        Just wrapped up my first large-scale enterprise project that's already making waves in Acas.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over the past months, I've designed and built a custom <a href="https://github.com/AcasDigital">automation
        framework</a> using Python and Selenium,
        transforming our testing infrastructure from the ground up.
    </p>
    <p>
        The results? We've slashed our internal software testing time from 6 hours per manual test to just 3 minutes per
        run! - that's a massive reduction! ðŸ’ª

    </p>

    <p>
        But the impact goes beyond numbers. I had the privilege of mentoring and upskilling one of our software testers
        into a Junior Software Engineer role, demonstrating how automation can create growth opportunities for our team.
    </p>

    <p>
        The framework is now successfully deployed to production, backed by comprehensive documentation to ensure
        long-term sustainability. The best part? This initiative is set to save our organisation Â£520K ðŸ¤¯ over the next
        three years.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project has reinforced my belief that effective automation isn't just about writing code â€“ it's about
        empowering people, driving efficiency, and creating lasting value.
