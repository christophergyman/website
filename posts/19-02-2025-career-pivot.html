    <h1>From Full Stack to Quant Development</h1>

        I'm excited to share my latest YouTube video where I break down my strategy for transitioning from Full Stack
        Engineering to Quantitative Development!
    </p>

    <p>
        Over the next 8-12 months, I'm embarking on an intensive learning journey. My goal isn't just to switch roles â€“
        it's to elevate my skills from a competent software engineer to an exceptional one.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why structured learning? In my experience, reading blogs and working full-time only get you so far. I'm taking a
        systematic approach, diving deep into carefully selected textbooks and materials.
    </p>
    <p>
        Expect detailed textbook reviews every 3-4 weeks as I share my insights and progress.
    </p>
    <p>
