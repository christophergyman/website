        <h1>This is my personal website.</h1>
        <p>And it's absolutely perfect.</p>
        <h2>Did you expect anything more?</h2>
        <p>
            The modern web has become too bloated with unnecessary features. All you need is basic
            HTML and CSS. Not another frontend javascript framework that takes a modern graphics card to render
            to the screen.
        </p>
        <p>Keep it simple.</p>
        <p class="quote">“A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing
            left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

        <h2>What you really came here for.</h2>
        <p>
            This page really serves as a jumping off point to more intresting pages lets be honest
            with ourselves.

        <h2>Epilogue.</h2>
        <p>Obviously this is a satire, however a fair artistic commentary about the over saturation and complexity
            of modern websites.
            This website took heavy-handed inspiration from <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">this</a>
            and also <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this</a>.
